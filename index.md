# About Me

Hi! I'm Maya Diamond, and I am a 3rd year Industrial engineering student studying at the University of Toronto. I love engineering as it is a discipline where I can explore the overlap between my creative side, and my love of math, coding, and logic.

# What I've Done

## Projects

### Helmet Assistive Communication Device for Autism Spectrum 

Worked with a multi-disciplinary team of engineering students designing a brain-sensing device for our client, InteraXon, to help improve communication for individuals with Autism Spectrum Disorder

### Optimizing Shoe Production Plan

Worked with a partner in my Operations Research class to create a shoe production plan for WARP Shoe Company, which would generate an optimal profit of over $11 million. Used Access and AMPL, and factored in budget, demand, capacity, machine operation hours, and shoe revenues

### Student and School Matching Algorithm

Implemented the Gale-Shapley algorithm in several iterations of a system to match students and schools, for my Object Oriented Programming Java course. Received 100% on all deliverables

### COVID-19 Mathematical Modelling

Used Python to create a dynamic SEIR model of the spread of COVID-19, which could be manipulated to see the impacts of preventative measures. Received 100% on the project

### Supply Chain Bullwhip Effect Mitigation

Worked with a team of engineering students, using Java Object Oriented Programming to simulate and reduce the Bullwhip Effect for a beer store’s supply chain

### Toronto Islands Flood Mitigation Communication System

Designed a communication system to help Toronto Islands residents during floods

### UofT’s Job Portal Redesign

Redesigned UofT’s Career and Co-Curricular Learning Network job board. Conducted user interviews, created low-fidelity prototypes, and conducted usability testing
